# 🧠 C Pointer Playground – Pyjamabrah Course By Piyush Itankar.

Welcome to a curated collection of **C pointer programs** inspired by instructor ***Piyush*** from the Pyjamabrah course series. Originally built for personal code maintenance, this repository is now shared to support beginners diving into the foundational depths of C pointers—with clarity, precision, and hands-on experimentation.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Just follow the Numbers of the file names and inside each and  every file there will be information of which part of the course is given.


Each `.c` file is fully commented and organized to guide learners from the basics to advanced concepts, reinforcing memory behavior through experimentation.

## 🔍 What's Inside

- Pointers in variables, arrays, and functions
- Stack vs Heap memory layouts
- Pointer arithmetic and type-based navigation
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `free`)
- Indirection and referencing at multiple levels
- Bonus: **Math library** for hands-on pointer-based calculations

## ✨ Maintainer

**MatheshVarma** – Junior Firmware Developer specializing in embedded systems and low-level hardware-software interaction. Passionate about mastering memory models, register-level programming, and supporting new learners in embedded logic and pointer fluency.

> 💬This started as a self-learning log and evolved into a helpful resource. I hope it supports anyone beginning their journey in C pointer programming.
