/*
    Pointer is a number(address in the memory)
    Types of pointers are 
        Data Pointers
        Functinon Pointers
        Void Pointers

    Data Pointers - where we have the data type mentioned
        eg: int *p; and char *ab; float*c;

    Function Pointers -Pointers will point to a memory region or  piece of code

    Void Pointers-It is just a pointer pointing to a memory and we dont know what might be stored there and no other information is it a code of how much memory no things we know(dont know)
